Physics Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing physical data related to acceleration, mass, and gravitational force. The code uses curve fitting (for exponential decay) and linear regression to model the relationships between the variables. Below is a guide on how to use the code and what each part does.

How to Use the Code
1. Exponential Decay Model: Acceleration vs Mass
This part of the code fits an exponential decay function to the relationship between acceleration and mass. The model assumes that acceleration decreases as mass increases, which is commonly seen in physical systems where forces act oppositely to mass growth.

Steps:
Input your data: Provide two lists or arrays, one for acceleration values and one for mass values.

Curve Fitting: The code uses curve_fit from the scipy.optimize library to fit an exponential decay function to your data. This function will automatically calculate the parameters (constants) that best fit your data to the model

b are the parameters to be determined.

Graph Generation: The code generates a graph with your original data points plotted and overlays the fitted exponential decay curve. This visually shows how well the model fits the data and how acceleration changes with mass.

How to Perform the Analysis:
Prepare your mass and acceleration data.
Call the function with these data values as inputs.
The graph will be displayed showing the data points and the fitted curve.
2. Linear Regression: Gravitational Force vs Mass
This part of the code analyzes the relationship between gravitational force and mass using a linear regression model. It assumes a direct proportional relationship, where gravitational force increases as mass increases.

Steps:
Input your data: Provide two arrays or lists, one for mass values and another for the corresponding gravitational force values.

Linear Regression: The code calculates the best-fit line by computing the slope of the line that goes through the origin (0, 0). This is done using a simple linear regression formula. The regression line is then used to extrapolate the gravitational force for a broader range of mass values.

Graph Generation: The code plots the original data points and the regression line, showing the relationship between mass and gravitational force. The line will also be extended to predict the gravitational force for mass values outside of the given range.

How to Perform the Analysis:
Input your mass and gravitational force data.
Call the function to perform linear regression and generate the graph.
The plot will display both the data points and the regression line, indicating how gravitational force changes with mass.
General Usage Instructions:
Prepare your data: Make sure your data is formatted as numerical arrays or lists.
Call the appropriate function: Based on whether you want to analyze acceleration vs mass (exponential decay) or gravitational force vs mass (linear regression), call the corresponding function with your data as input.
View the plot: After calling the function, a plot will be displayed showing your data points and the fitted model/line. You can adjust the ranges and parameters to customize the plot as needed.
Requirements:
To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:

numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
matplotlib: For plotting the graphs.
scipy: For performing the curve fitting.
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
